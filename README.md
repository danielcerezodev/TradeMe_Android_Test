# TradeMe_Android_Test

## Things that I would like to add if time permited:
* Pagination: load more items as you the user scrolls as well as adding over scroll behaviour to update recycler view.
* Implement both list view and grid view for items (currently just grid view). This view doesn't translate very well to horizontal orientation.
* Network detection: See if the user is offline and display views and placeholders accordingly.
* Animations: Currently there is only one (on fragment open).
* Update UI: Add placeholder buttons and better placeholder images to mimic more the Trade Me look.
